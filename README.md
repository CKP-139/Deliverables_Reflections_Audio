## Submitting Your Deliverables

**IMPORTANT: Make sure all your files are properly named, according to the [Audio Asset List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BrEyCMVV9yoaVaJyiFoW6sE90hxjVQKrfHqTLCJoTq8/edit?gid=2044568224#gid=2044568224)!**

1. **`Fetch origin`** in GitHub Desktop. This updates the folder on your device or hard drive.
2. **Make your changes**. Upload your file to the appropriate folder, based on the type of sound and the deadline.
3. **Describe your changes.** Write a clear title for your edit (e.g. "Added first version of mus_title", 
"Added updated version of mus_title"), and clearly go over the changes in your description ("I added the B-section, and mixed the lead to be quieter.").
4. **`Commit` your changes**. `Commit [#] file(s) to main` updates the current branch you're working on. (For this project, all changes will be on the **main** branch. In larger projects, you might have a branch for your own specific team, but this project and its smaller scope will solely use the **main** branch.)
5. **`Push origin`**.  This updates the cloud repository on GitHub to include your newly uploaded file, along with the descriptions you write. 

You're done!
